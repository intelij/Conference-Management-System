# Conference-Management-System
A Conference Management system done using HTML,PHP as part of my Case Tools Laboratory.

The project starts with the homepage.html file and provides facilities to filter booking by either room/time. After booking, It also provides a profile for users to take a quick recap of their bookings.

There is an Xampp server that hosts the webpage in localhost. It also hosts a database that contains the following tables:

login(username,password);
it_seminar_hall(dat,tim,person);
mini_auditorium(dat,tim,person);
main_auditorium(dat,tim,person);
central_seminar_hall(dat,tim,person);
